# Node JS Acceleration Task 4 (6/12/17)
## Explore function of a social media Website

We were asked to use a piece of data of data about users to create anything we wanted with some few rules, which included using just vanilla JS and JQUery.

Well we built an explore function of a social media website that allows you to view a list of all users profiles on the website and to view the profile of any user.

It was built using Vanilla JS, Jquery, a dash of bootstrap with some help from SCSS.

Built with love from Ife, tomiiide, Kemi, Bola, Ego($).
